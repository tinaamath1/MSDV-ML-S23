I used silhoutte method for 2 clusters based on the image above, it appeared as though there was a slight elbow at 2 clusters. But I don't think that two clusters with a data set this large will be helpful.

Seeing the same amount of clusters here, I did not not continue with the silhoutte method because again I thought 2 clusters were too litte.

At this point I am feeling good about 15 clusters as the product descriptions are grouping together logically.
